# Contributing Guidelines

## General Guidelines

-   Follow [the code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
-   Stay on topic
-   Use reactions instead of meaningless comments, AKA react with thumbs-up instead of commenting "Good idea".

## Issue Guidelines

-   Choose a relevant category.
-   Search for duplicates before opening an issue.
-   Use Issues for announcements, bugs, and feature requests only.

## Discussion Guidelines

-   Choose a relevant category.
-   Mark comments that answer your question as the answer.
-   Only use Discussions for questions, comments, and other related topics. Do not request new features or report bugs in Discussions; they will be closed and ignored.
-   Read [the docs](https://auth.onedot.cf/docs) before asking for help.

## Code/PR Guidelines

-   Enable actions on your fork by going to the Actions tab (on your fork) and pushing the button. That will add automatic linting and formatting to your code.
-   It is highly recommended to [create a PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `repo` and `workflow` scopes and put it in a secret on your fork called `WGYTBOT`. That is so code formatting will work more seamlessly.
-   Fill out the template. Replace all comments (text flanked by `<!--` and `-->`).
-   Minimize lint errors.
-   Open an issue before you start working on something.
-   Only work on issues that have a `priority` label and do not have an assignee.
-   Write meaningful commit messages, AKA more than one word long.
-   If your PR is merged, we may add you to the [contributors list](htps://auth.onedot.cf/docs/credits.md). This process is automated. If you do not want to be on the list, please tell us. If you do want to be on the list but you weren't automatically added, you can [use the All Contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).
