# Contributing Guidelines

## General Guidelines

-   Follow [the code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
-   Stay on topic
-   Use reactions instead of meaningless comments, AKA react with thumbs-up instead of commenting "Good idea".

## Issue Guidelines

-   Choose a relevant category.
-   Search for duplicates before opening an issue.
-   Use Issues for announcements, bugs, and feature requests only.

## Discussion Guidelines

-   Choose a relevant category.
-   Mark comments that answer your question as the answer.
-   Only use Discussions for questions, comments, and other related topics. Do not request new features or report bugs in Discussions; they will be closed and ignored.
-   Read [the docs](https://auth.onedot.cf/docs) before asking for help.

## Code/PR Guidelines

-   Enable actions on your fork by going to the Actions tab (on your fork) and pushing the button. That will add automatic linting and formatting to your code.
-   It is highly reccomended to [create a PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `repo` and `workflow` scopes and put it in a secret on your fork called `WGYTBOT`. That is so code formatting will work more seemlessly.
-   Fill out the template. Replace all comments (text flanked by `<!--` and `-->`).
-   Minimize lint errors.
-   Open an issue before you start working on something.
-   Only work on issues that have a `priority` label and do not have an assignee.
-   Write meaningful commit messages, AKA more than one word long.
